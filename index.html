							<h2>Game-Making</h2>
							<p>During my first few months in College I became interested in Game Creation. Finding that Game Engines were some of the best ways to create games, I began to learn <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. I ended up choosing to re-create a 2D video game that I had enjoyed, <a href="https://enterthegungeon.com/">Enter The Gungeon</a>. In this project I wrote a few thousand lines of code, and became familar with the C# language.</p>

							<h2>Wordle-Solver</h2>
							<p>A few months ago a word guessing game called Wordle had gotten extremely popular. While I was playing the game I became curious, was there a combination of 5 consecutive words that didn't have a single letter in common? Initally I had tried to solve it by selecting words by hand, but it was just too difficult. That is when I started to code an algorithm to solve this problem, eventually coming up with multiple solutions. After this I became interested in creating an website to solve wordles for you, this can be found <a href="https://wordlesolver.000webhostapp.com/">here.</a> </p>

							<h2>Software Design</h2>
							<p>I am currently in a Software Design class were we have began to work in teams to create a app using Facebooks React Native framework. Our team decided to create a Video Game and called it <em>Kingdom Crisis</em>. We are currently polishing it to be ready for the end of the year.</p>

							<h2>Familiar Languages/Topics</h2>
							<p>Although I am still a freshman, I have started to become familiar with many different languages and workspaces.</p>
							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>C++</h3>
									<p>I would say I am very fluent in C++ and it is my strongest language by far. It has been the topic of my last two classes and was the original language I built the<a href="#third"> Wordle Solver </a>in.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-save"></span>
									<h3>C#</h3>
									<p>I am decently fluent in C#, but nothing like C++. As I only ever used it for the<a href="#third"> Unity Projects </a>, I never really got to fully explore the language.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-chart-bar"></span>
									<h3>Javascript</h3>
									<p>Limited fluency. Javascript is relatively new to me, I initally was learning it to put the<a href="#third"> Wordle Solver </a>into a webpage. After a while though I realized that I preferred statically typed languages much more and swapped to Typescript.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-wifi"></span>
									<h3>Typescript</h3>
									<p>Limited fluency. While delving into Javascript, I learned about this language and became very intriguied by it. Eventually swapping over and completing the<a href="#third"> Wordle Solver </a> in Typescript.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>HTML</h3>
									<p>Something I had to understand when working on web-development.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-paper-plane"></span>
									<h3>CSS</h3>
									<p>Similar to HTML, just was something I learned along-side web-development.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>React Native</h3>
									<p>Decent fluency. What <a href="third">Kingdom Crisis</a> is primarily being made in.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-sync-alt"></span>
									<h3>Rust</h3>
									<p>Only the basics. I had heard of Rust a while ago on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> as it was one of the most like languages in the world. So very recently I have just been going through the basics of the language.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-hashtag"></span>
									<h3>Java</h3>
									<p>I had taken a semester based in this language a year or two ago, but honestly can't remember what we even did.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-bolt"></span>
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>Decently fluent. My first programming class was based in this language and I have messed around with a few things since. Generally I prefer other languages over Python.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-envelope"></span>
									<h3>Github</h3>
									<p>Have been using Github by myself for about a year, but in the last few months have gotten to use it as a collabratively for my <a href="#third">Software Design</a> team project.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-leaf"></span>
									<h3>Video Editting</h3>
									<p>I have a few 10k+ viewed videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ItzToxicYEP/videos">Youtube Channel</a>. I have also created a intro video for my local church.</p>
